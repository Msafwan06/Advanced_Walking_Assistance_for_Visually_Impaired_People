# Advanced_Walking_Assistance_for_Visually_Impaired_People

An ESP8266-based IoT system using ultrasonic sensors, a pulse sensor, piezoelectric vibration detection, and a buzzer to provide real-time obstacle alerts and health monitoring for visually impaired individuals. Data is sent to [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) via MQTT for remote tracking and analysis.

## 📦 Features

- 🔊 **Obstacle Detection** using Ultrasonic Sensor
- 🫀 **Pulse Monitoring** with analog pulse sensor
- 🔔 **Buzzer Alerts** when obstacles are detected
- 🦶 **Vibration Detection** with Piezoelectric Sensor for footstep or impact monitoring
- ☁️ **IoT Integration** with Adafruit IO (MQTT)
- 📈 **Live Sensor Data** visualization via cloud dashboard
- 📶 WiFi-enabled via **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)**
